# Social Media Project

### About

This social media project is built with React and Material UI. It is a mock
social media application. A user can post a "memory" including a picture
uploaded by the user, a title, message, and tags. Users can also like other
users' "memories". A user can sign up and sign in using an email and password or
google login. A user can only delete or edit a "memory" that they created.
